# Final_Dashboard

As an avid fan of Formula 1, I was excited to be able to work with this data. Building the dashboard was both interesting and a learning experience. I learned about the importance of UI and UX, and learned how to confidently use Dash to build and deploy apps. In my full-time role next year, I look forward to being able to share what I learned, as they build many dashboards for clients.
